1- how to handle the counterpart of accumulative ack?
2- How to handle timeouts and finished processing (we did it by using messages, by utilizing the header)?
3- Are Buffered frames processed again?


Hashish's idea: 
//assuming that nodes process in send and recieve and also process buffered frames too
get max of (FinishTimeofLastProcessing, simTime()) +PT
